NEURAL NETWORKS
These artificial networks may be used for predictive modelling , adaptive control and applications where they can be trained via a dataset. Self-learning resulting from experience can occur within networks, which can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.
Variables:
    xij -  input from unit I into unit j
    wij - weight from unit I to unit j
    âˆ†wji â€“ change in weight

Algorithm:
    Step1: Initialize the network weights (value in range (0, 1))
    Step2: Calculate the output 
    Step3: Modify the weights and repeat the Step2 until the error is minimised
Error is calculated using the Least Mean Square Method.
Modifying Weights:
    wji  ðŸ¡¨  wji + âˆ†wji
    âˆ†wji = Æž áºŸj xji 


 
The average accuracy obtained is 75.5 %.
